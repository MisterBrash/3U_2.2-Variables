### 2.2 - Variables & Math
###### ICS3 - Mr. Brash 🐿️

# 📝 Your Task:
(Read carefully and work with a partner if you are struggling - ask Mr. Brash only after asking a classmate)

- This repo has been setup already for you with an [HTML page](./index.html) and a [JavaScript code file](./main.js).
- When you preview the HTML page, the JavaScript will run in the background after the page loads.
- Open the developer tools (`CTRL+SHIFT+J` or `Menu > More Tools > Developer Tools`) to see the console.



When you are sure that you've followed the instructions _perfectly_, ask Mr. Brash to check your work.

🕒 If you finish with class time left, you can do independent learning.
