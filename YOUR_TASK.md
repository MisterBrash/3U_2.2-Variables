### 2.2 - Variables & Math
###### ICS3 - Mr. Brash 🐿️

# 📝 Your Task:
(Read carefully and work with a partner if you are struggling - ask Mr. Brash only after asking a classmate)

- This repo has been setup already for you with an [HTML page](./index.html) and a [JavaScript code file](./main.js).
- When you preview the HTML page, the JavaScript will run in the background after the page loads.
- Open the developer tools (`CTRL+SHIFT+J` or `Menu > More Tools > Developer Tools`) to see the console.

##### Part 1
1. Create a variable `length` and set it equal to 10
2. Create a variable `width` and set it equal to 5
3. Calculate the area of a rectangle using `length` and `width` - store the answer in a new variable `area`
<br>(Note: to multiply, use the 'asterisk' `*`) **Example:**
```JS
let x = 3;
let multiplied_value = x * 4;   // This would be 12
```
4. Output the value of the `area` variable to the console.
5. Output the area again, but this time like this: `Area: 50`  {use the `area` variable for the number}

##### Part 2
1. Create a variable called `first_name` and set the value to "Santa".
2. Create a variable called `last_name` and set the value to "Claws".
3. On the next code line, set the value of `last_name` to "Claus".
4. Using the _variables_ you made in 1 and 2, print "I still believe in Santa Claus." to the console.

🕒 If you finish with class time left, you can do independent learning.
