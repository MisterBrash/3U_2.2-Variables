### 2.1 - Output & the Console
###### ICS3U - Mr. Brash 🐿️

# 📝 Your Tasks:
(Read carefully and work with a partner if you are struggling - ask Mr. Brash only after asking a classmate)

- This repo has been setup already for you with an [HTML page](./index.html) and a [JavaScript code file](./main.js).
- When you preview the HTML page, the JavaScript will run in the background after the page loads!
- Use the developer tools (`CTRL+SHIFT+J` or `Menu > More Tools > Developer Tools`) to get to the console.

#### 1. Add the appropriate code(s) to the JavaScript file [`main.js`](./main.js) that will print the address for Apple Inc.:

>Apple Inc.<br>One Apple Park Way<br>Cupertino, CA<br>95014<br>+1 408-996-1010

#### 2. Output two blank lines (to separate task 1 and 3)

#### 3. Now print the following with only a SINGLE `console.log( )` command:

>Microsoft Corporation<br>One Microsoft Way<br>Redmond, WA<br>98052<br>+1 425-882-8080

#### 4. Output two blank lines (to separate task 3 and 5)

#### 5. Finally, output the following to the console using _one_ `console.log( )` command with horizontal tabs between the letters:

```
x  o  x
o  x  o
x  o  x
```

When you are sure that you've followed the instructions _perfectly_, ask Mr. Brash to check your work.
